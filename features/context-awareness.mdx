## Overview

Context Awareness is EnConvo's core technology that enables it to understand what you're working on and provide relevant, intelligent assistance. Instead of asking you to explain your context, EnConvo sees and understands your screen, active applications, and current tasks.

<YouTubePlayer videoId="VKhyKibToAw" title="Context Awareness Overview & Demo" />

## How It Works

EnConvo uses advanced screen analysis to understand:

### 1. Active Application Detection
EnConvo knows which application you're using and adapts its responses accordingly:

| Application | Context Provided |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Web Browser | Current URL, page title, visible content |
| Code Editor | Programming language, file path,  code content |
| Finder | Selected files, current directory |
| Other Apps | Current window content & Screenshot |


### 2. More Contextual responses
Based on context, EnConvo can provide more contextual responses:
- Coding? Offers debugging help, documentation lookup, etc.
- Writing? Suggests grammar fixes, tone improvements, etc.
- Browsing? Provides summaries, translations, etc.

## Manual Context Control
<Tip>
 Use `#` prefix to add context to your queries.
</Tip>

### Context Modifiers

Use these prefixes for specific context types:

```
#screen - Include current screen content
#finder - Include current Finder selection
#clipboard - Include clipboard content
#browser - Include current browser tab
#... (and more)
```

## Privacy & Security

<Warning>
Context data never leaves your Mac without your explicit action. All processing happens locally or through your chosen AI provider only when you submit a query.
</Warning>


### Exclusions
Configure apps or content to exclude from context:

1. Go to Settings → Context Awareness
2. Add applications to the exclusion list

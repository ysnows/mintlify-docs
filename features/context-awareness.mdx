description: "How EnConvo understands your screen and provides relevant assistance"
---

## Overview

Context Awareness is EnConvo's core technology that enables it to understand what you're working on and provide relevant, intelligent assistance. Instead of asking you to explain your context, EnConvo sees and understands your screen, active applications, and current tasks.

## How It Works

EnConvo uses advanced screen analysis to understand:

### 1. Active Application Detection
EnConvo knows which application you're using and adapts its responses accordingly:

| Application | Context Provided |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Web Browser | Current URL, page title, visible content |
| Code Editor | Programming language, file path, visible code |
| Finder | Selected files, current directory |
| Mail | Email content, sender, subject |
| Documents | Document content, format type |

### 2. Visual Content Analysis
EnConvo can analyze:
- Text on screen (via OCR)
- Images and diagrams
- UI elements and layouts
- Code syntax highlighting

### 3. User Intent Recognition
Based on context, EnConvo predicts what you might need:
- Coding? Offers debugging help, documentation lookup
- Writing? Suggests grammar fixes, tone improvements
- Browsing? Provides summaries, translations

## Enabling Context Awareness

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grant Screen Recording Permission">
    Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording → Enable EnConvo
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart EnConvo">
    Quit and relaunch EnConvo for permissions to take effect
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Context">
    Open SmartBar and press `Tab` to see the current context preview
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Context in Queries

### Automatic Context
When enabled, EnConvo automatically includes relevant context with your queries.

### Manual Context Control
You have full control over when context is used:

| Action | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Include screen | Press `Tab` in SmartBar |
| Exclude context | Start query with `!` |
| Specific area | Press `⌘ Shift Tab` to select region |
| Include clipboard | Press `⌘ V` in SmartBar |

### Context Modifiers

Use these prefixes for specific context types:

```
@screen - Include full screen capture
@selection - Include selected text only
@app - Include active app context
@clipboard - Include clipboard content
@file - Reference a specific file
@webpage - Include current webpage
```

## Privacy & Security

<Warning>
Context data never leaves your Mac without your explicit action. All processing happens locally or through your chosen AI provider only when you submit a query.
</Warning>

### Data Handling
- **Local Processing**: Screen captures are processed locally
- **On-Demand Only**: Data only sent when you initiate a query
- **No Storage**: Screen captures are not stored on any server
- **No Training**: Your data is never used for AI training

### Exclusions
Configure apps or content to exclude from context:

1. Go to Settings → Privacy → Context Exclusions
2. Add applications to the exclusion list
3. Enable "Blur sensitive content" for password fields

## Context-Aware Features

- Relevant plugins
- Common actions

### Adaptive Responses
AI responses adapt to your context:
- Technical explanations for developers
- Simplified answers for non-technical apps
- Language-specific help based on code files

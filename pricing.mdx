## Points System

EnConvo uses a points system for AI operations:

| Operation | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Chat message (GPT-3.5) | ~5 points |
| Chat message (GPT-4) | ~20 points |
| Chat message (Claude) | ~15 points |
| Image generation | ~50 points |

<Tip>
Use your own API key to bypass the points system entirely and only pay for actual usage through your provider.

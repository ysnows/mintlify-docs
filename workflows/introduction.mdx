## Overview

Workflows in EnConvo allow you to chain multiple plugins and actions together, automating complex tasks with a single command. Instead of running individual actions separately, create workflows that handle entire processes automatically.

## What Are Workflows?

A workflow is a sequence of actions that execute in order:

```
Input → Action 1 → Action 2 → Action 3 → Output
```

For example, a "Research & Report" workflow might:
1. Search the web for a topic
2. Summarize the findings
3. Format as a report
4. Save to your Knowledge Base

## Why Use Workflows?

## Built-in Workflows

EnConvo includes several pre-built workflows:

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Research Summary** | Web search → Analyze → Summarize → Format |
| **Content Review** | OCR/Input → Grammar → Style → Improve |
| **Code Analysis** | Read code → Explain → Review → Document |
| **Translation Pipeline** | Detect language → Translate → Proofread |
| **Meeting Notes** | Transcribe → Summarize → Action items → Save |

## Workflow Components

### Triggers

How a workflow starts:
- **Manual**: Run from SmartBar with `/workflow name`
- **Hotkey**: Assign a keyboard shortcut
- **Automatic**: Triggered by events (e.g., file added)
- **Scheduled**: Run at specific times

### Actions

The steps in your workflow:
- AI prompts
- Plugin calls
- File operations
- Data transformations
- Conditional logic

### Outputs

Where results go:
- Display in chat
- Copy to clipboard
- Save to file
- Add to Knowledge Base
- Send notification

## Running Workflows

### From SmartBar

```
/workflow [workflow-name]
/workflow Research Summary "AI in healthcare"
```

### From Companion Orb

Click the Workflows icon and select a workflow to run.

### With Keyboard Shortcuts

Assign hotkeys in Settings → Workflows → [Workflow] → Shortcut

## Organizing Knowledge

### Collections

Organize your knowledge into collections:

```
Knowledge Base
├── Work Projects
│   ├── Project Alpha docs
│   └── Meeting notes
├── Personal
│   ├── Learning materials
│   └── Recipes
└── Reference
    ├── Technical documentation
    └── Research papers
```

### Tags

Add tags to documents for better organization:
- Auto-suggested tags based on content
- Custom tags for your workflow
- Filter by multiple tags

### Search & Browse

- **Full-text search**: Find content by keywords
- **Semantic search**: Find content by meaning
- **Browse by collection**: Navigate your collections
- **Recent items**: Quick access to recently added

## Querying Your Knowledge Base

### Automatic Reference

When enabled, EnConvo automatically references your knowledge base for relevant queries.

### Explicit Reference

Use the `@kb` modifier to explicitly search your knowledge base:

```
@kb What did we decide about the authentication system?
@kb Find all mentions of customer feedback
@kb Summarize my notes on machine learning
```

### Collection-Specific Queries

Reference specific collections:

```
@kb:work What are the project deadlines?
@kb:recipes How do I make pasta carbonara?
```

## Features

### Smart Retrieval

EnConvo uses semantic understanding to find relevant information, even if:
- Different words are used
- Information is spread across documents
- Content is in different formats

### Source Citations

Responses include citations to source documents:
- Click to view source
- See context around citations
- Verify AI-generated answers

### Question Answering

Ask natural language questions:
- "What is our refund policy?"
- "When did we last discuss the budget?"
- "What are the steps to deploy to production?"

### Summarization

Generate summaries of your knowledge:
- "Summarize all my notes from last week"
- "What are the key themes in these documents?"

## Privacy & Security

<Note>
Your knowledge base data is stored locally on your Mac by default. Cloud sync is optional and encrypted.
</Note>

### Storage Options

| Option | Location | Sync |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Local Only** | ~/Library/Application Support/EnConvo | No |
| **iCloud** | iCloud Drive | Across Macs |
| **Custom** | Your chosen location | Manual |

### Encryption

- Local storage: macOS keychain encryption
- Cloud sync: End-to-end encryption
- API calls: No document content sent by default

## Configuration

### Settings → Knowledge Base

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auto-reference** | Include KB in all queries |
| **Max sources** | Number of sources to include |
| **Chunk size** | Document splitting size |
| **Embedding model** | Model for indexing |
| **Storage location** | Where to store data |

## Managing Your Knowledge Base

### Viewing Documents

1. Open Settings → Knowledge Base → Documents
2. Browse or search your documents
3. Click to view content and metadata

### Editing Documents

- Update content without re-uploading

### Re-indexing

If search quality degrades, re-index your knowledge base:

1. Go to Settings → Knowledge Base → Advanced
2. Click "Re-index All"
3. Wait for processing to complete

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Organize from the start">
    Create a clear collection structure before adding lots of documents. It's easier to maintain than reorganizing later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names">
    Name files descriptively: "Q4-2024-Marketing-Plan.pdf" is better than "doc1.pdf"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add context">
    Include notes about why documents are important or how they should be used.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular maintenance">
    Periodically review and remove outdated documents to keep your knowledge base accurate.
  </Accordion>
